### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christophe and I'm a software engineer from Noumea, New Caledonia.
I graduated from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France and currently working as a fullstack software engineer at Sopra Steria.
I mainly code in Java and Angular but I'm eager to learn other languages (currently aiming at NodeJS and Python)
I am also reading books and learning about software craftmanship.

Take care !
