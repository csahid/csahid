### Hi there, I'm Christophe ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer from Noumea, New Caledonia.

I graduated from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France and currently working as a fullstack developer at DEVmachine.

I mainly code in Java and Angular but I'm eager to learn other languages and frameworks (currently aiming at Node.js and Vue.js)

I am also reading books and learning about software craftmanship.
